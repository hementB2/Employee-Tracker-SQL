# Overview

## The Challenge:

Develop an interface to facilitate effortless access and interaction with data housed within an SQL Employee Tracker database, tailored for non-developers. Such interfaces, commonly referred to as Content Management Systems (CMS), aim to simplify data management tasks. The objective entails crafting a command-line application from the ground up to oversee a company's employee database, leveraging Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL technologies. Upon completion, produce a walkthrough video showcasing the functionality and meeting the defined acceptance criteria, with the possibility of including additional bonus criteria.

## User Story

## Installation Process

Install the following: 
- Inquirer.js: 
- MySQL2: 
- Console.table


### Continued Development:
1. Implement a 'History' functionality to track the dates of employee 'Additions' and 'Removals'.
2. Refine file and folder arrangement by establishing multiple subfolders for the server.js file to enhance organization and segregate additional Inquirer features.
